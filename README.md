Build 3D model using OpenCV

E was described in almost the exact same words as the homography
matrix H in the previous section. Although both are constructed from similar information, they are not the
same matrix and should not be confused. An essential part of the defi nition of H is that we were considering
a plane viewed by a camera and thus could relate one point in that plane to the point on the camera plane.
Th e matrix E makes no such assumption and so will only be able to relate a point in one image to a line in
the other.
